street and a whole group of is distinguished guests and a lot of our distinguished guess we have a lot of other people here and i won't bother anymore that's enough because we have to talk about crypto we have to talk about bitcoin we have to talk about all these great cup but our country's blessed to have the extraordinary talent energy and genius representative this room and really is great genius not all of you but most severe many of you but there's that kind of spirit that built america and this the spirit that's going to help us make america great again would do i stand before you today filled with respect and admiration for what the bitcoin community is achieved so incredible actually i sort of say to my son's it's like incredible causation so much about it is so they so aware of it much more so than people that are a little bit older but i say this is the steel industry of one hundred years ago really is i think you're just in your infancy i can see it happen it just fifteen years bitcoin has gone from merely an idea posted anonymously on an internet message board to being denied most valuable asset anywhere in the world can you believe that is that right that's big deal they get that it's already bigger than exxon mobil soon it will be surpassing the entire market cap of silver that bad about go to have about goal does go go and one day i probably will overtake go but based on the way it's going now it could very well be a possibility there's never been anything like it and i don't think you've ever seen anything like it and most people have no idea what the hell it is you know that right so what happens when they figured out there's going to really be something bitcoin is not just a marvel of technology is you know it's a miracle of cooperation and human achievement is a lot of relationships that are formed registered a meeting around table with a lot of the leaders and amazing is a great camaraderie really interesting this obviously there's competition but there's a relationship is a friendship that's developed with a lot of these people i noticed that i don't usually see that too often i see the opposite actually they want to they want to get each other they want to kill each other these guys have a great feeling very smart people to congratulations and all that you've accomplished this room is amazing the people in this room high i q individuals i'm running against a low i q individual her i'm not even talking about it i got a low i q individually the reason i've come to address the bitcoin community today can be summed up in to very simple words america first because if we don't do it chinese get to be doing our there's gotta be doing it let's do it and do it right my vision is for in america that dominates the future we have the best economy the higher standard of living the safest the most beautiful cities and by the way when i say safest or cities are going to hell right now our cities are going to how we're going to fix their cities were going to work with democrats said have destroyed our cities but will work with them and we're going to get our cities back or going to bring our country back  and we really were the freest and the most ambitious most dynamic nation ever to exist on earth and we're going to get that back again because when that they are now we're a nation in decline you know what we know it doesn't sound nice but it's okay because we're going to bring it back or going to bring it back fantasy right now it's it there are saying embarrassing was out and even today when you look at what we just said that would never have happened if they respected our country if we don't embrace crypto and bitcoin technology china will other countries will they'll dominate and we that led china dominate they are making too much progress as it is and we wanted to be successful know what china be successful but we have to be the most success of the woods going to so it's going to have i want the united states could be first in technology first in science first that manufacturing first an artificial intelligence and first in space you know and m i t my uncle was a professor there doctor john trump he would have fit in with this room very nicely actually that's why i mentioned it and i believe he was the longest serving professor in the history of mit he graduated we have a very intelligent family actually he graduated tremendously and against three different degrees but they said would you like to stay on john and a professor well i've got a lot of offers i assume he said but i get a lot of off as well would like he was there for i believe forty one years what i was in the white house the head of mit came to see me and they presented me with a book on my own while he was legendary guy in the academic world and in the world of mit so i understand a lot about what you're doing and i have great respect for highly intelligent people and you are highly intelligent america's destiny is to lead our rivals and everything and to surrender our industries to no one who no one you know some of your involved with a i but you also have the same thing you need a thing called electricity you need a lot of electricity you know ai needs to be really dominant in china can do it much easier we have environmental impacts sapiens to do but we're going to do things that nobody thought were possible you need tremendous amounts of electricity you need double of the electricity of the entire electricity that we have right now and the united states to dominate and will get that done who would think we can get that done but we're going to get it will be having power plants spill at the sites will be releasing people from shirt ridiculous requirements and we'll be using fossil fuel to make electricity because we're going to have to will be using nuclear will be doing it in an environmentally friendly way but we will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying please please president we don't want anymore so do we can't stand it we'll be back at me no more electricity sir we have enough if we have enough you know in the midwest they just opened was very interesting they just opened up to chargers you know a charger for the electric cars and and you know i love real on is great endorsed me and great endorsement everything else but not a everybody has to have an electric car i told them the so we're going to get rid of that mandate if you don't mind some people want gasoline propelled car some people want a hybrid and some people like electric car they're great either a great i think what he's done is graded i think he understands that i guess you probably would have endorsed me into those were my this but he did and it's just like they did these chargers in the midwest their eight of them they spent nine billion dollars to build a charges teacher i get by car and at that rate and would cost approximately twelve trillion dollars to put the charges were somehow that's that work in the country would have to file for chapter eleven will do a chapter you know it's called chapter seven and set of a chapter eleven but it's the equivalent now we have to use our brain we have to be wheeler the party of common sense okay we have to have common sense but what we do have to do is we have to produce tremendous electric or a and for all of the other things including the things that you're doing and will get it produced a we're going to get to produce best a when i could be able to compete with china and other countries so we're going to get to produce fair this afternoon i'm laying out my plan to ensure that the united states will be the crypto capital of the planet and that bitcoin super power of the world and will get it if crypto is going to define the future i want to be mine the mid did and made in the usa it's going to be a sock going to be made anywhere else said of bitcoin is going to the moon as we say is god did about i want to america to be the nation that leads the way and that's what's going to happen though you're going to be very happy with me to be so happy he a disease that greatest guy that's why i'm proud to be the first major party nominee in american history to accept donations in bitcoin and crypto and they've made a lot of of my my tell you and i appreciate it since were made that announcement on may twenty first we have already raised twenty five million dollars bunch of it and bitcoin crypto and others others that are very very good also but as you know our excitement about the future of bitcoin and crypto could not be more difficult from the approach of our a polish campy look our opponents have gone a difficult route it go on old fashioned stuff we're going to take it right down the middle we are going to were so different from anybody else in terms of the campaign for suppose we understand that they don't understand it they are blocking your path they're blocking your way but i've made it a lot easier for you because the se she's been very very tough on you and now a see that you've embraced me all of a sudden people that were under investigation the big let go they say oh we don't want to do that will love grip and retaliate if they win this election every one of you will began they will be vicious there will be ruthless they will do things that you wouldn't believe but right now because of me they're leaving you alone so please say thank you president trump thank you very much and the reason that doing that is i've heard from some of your great geniuses that talk to me about this subject i've heard from the vic a one hundred and seventy five million people in some form or involved with this world of crypto and bitcoin and all of the others one hundred and seventy five million so when they heard that they said let's be nice to them at least until after the election so i've taken a lot of pressure of a lot of people lot of people are very happy today that about three months ago weren't so thrill three and a half years is that right lucky speech issue as and you know it's right but three to have years the current administration is wage they wore on crypto and bitcoin like nobody's ever seen before for those who work at this industry they target your bags they choke off your financial services have people say that is there they have been a heads up they block ordinary americans from transferring money to your exchanges they slander year a slander use criminals but that happened to me too because i said the election was rigged he said the election was rigged you should spend the rest of his life in jail for make that statement because they say it about us that it's okay or it now and by the way we're doing very well on the election you know we lost a candidate recently worker joe job and and i thought we lost this wonderful person and there's actually a terrible human being of you want to know the truth of elsa and we have another worse and worse human being but and i i should have made an analogy last night last night think of this i was speaking in front of a very powerful than very strong very religious group christian group christian evangelicals questions and then today i come in front of bitcoin and now are going to minnesota you do a rally you think my life is so great don't you couldn't cover a lot of territory go from religion to bitcoin too early and i don't get it mixed up like other people do  where they come out on those say may god bless everybody involved in the bitcoin world but actually we mean that because you need blessing because you've gotta do something very spectacular but we had an incredible an incredible time last night talking to are christians largely christians christian group and this is so great and that way of a very big rally in minnesota hasn't been one since nineteen seventy two richard nixon can you believe it and i think you know i think we're leading minnesota but there's some hanky panky that goes on in minnesota but i think we're doing good so we're going to leave here we're going to go there for a big rally but this is such an honor to be with you shared lee when we see the attacks on crypto it's a part of a much larger pattern that's being carried out by the same left wing fascists the guys government against any threat to their power they've done it to me did you see i just won the big case in florida thank you very much of a house the robots now it's a big case that was the documented case i have presidential records act on my side by done by the way by they said his what they said they said he's guilty as hell but we're not going to charge him because he's incompetent i won the case year old fashioned way it's called you win i wouldn't have wanted to win the way he won trump won the case because they call them incompetent think of this so they call them incompetent though he's incompetent to run for try to stand trial but he's that incompetent the run the country how does that work but he's not doing it anymore because you didn't do particularly well in the debate did anybody watch debate that dramatically somebody said to me you did horribly and the debate as to why is is no way he can continue forward so bad it was a said i understand that and that's exactly what happened actually we had a great debate it was a tremendous debate actually and since then a look you have to open the eyes you after you have to see what's going on we have a country to run the problem is that kamala is worse than joe is worse she's a radical left lunatic the fund the police all of the different things and so far we're doing she got a little honeymoon going on right now but when people hear about her and she's against crypto by the wages against that very big so i just want to let you know you gotta get out you gotta get out and how it should be no surprise that these same totalitarians are hell bent on crushing crypto and obliterating and that's what they want to do and that's what they are stated they a while i mean there there right now you have the fcc you know what they're doing obliterating bitcoin the region could not be more clear because bitcoin and stands for freedom sovereignty and independence from government for and biden harris administration's repression of crypto and bitcoin is wrong and it's very bad for our country is really quite an american as you know six days ago we officially defeated the worst president in the history of the united states i believe he was the worst president in the history of the united states think of it millions and millions of people have come into our country they've come in from jails they've come in from think of it insane asylum so mental institutions they've come in as terrorists we have the largest number of tears coming into our country right now the same people that you just heard about from israel a did that in israel they're coming in and nobody checksum nobody knows what's going on we have no idea what's going on they've lost control over a country and only bad things can happen so it's not going to be that way we're not going to let that happen were beating them and were beating them badly and we have to make sure that we do we need to do it for a country and you can't just be a fighter and have you a man lose the vague or woman but in this case a man he's losing the fight is now our by fifteen sixteen seventeen points they say that you're not going to win joe you gotta get out he didn't want to get out you said i'm not getting out he said you're getting our he said i'm not getting out i got fourteen million votes i'm not getting out they said if you're not getting out we're going to institute the twenty fifth amendment on your mental components he said like i said before think i'm going to get out okay and they got em our but it's like think this if i if you you're really campaign you spend a lot of money allotted time a lot of effort and he's losing and then they say let's take amount of the fight will put a new fighter and their the new fighters her probably my second choice he will always be my first choice because she'd be my second choice and again if we you don't win this race and i know you're not that political but you have to be political cause your whole thing i mean you have a lot of politics involved in what you do if we don't win this race this country could be finished as we know at this country's going to be in bad shape or we have to be in there we have to fight and we have to women and i pledge to the bitcoin community that the day i take the oath of office job biden kamala harris is anti crypto crusade will be over it will end it'll be done the moment i'm sworn in the persecution stops and the weaponization ends against your industry and as long as i'm in the oval office elizabeth warren pocahontas to members yes i'm an indian share seizure i'm an indian why are you an indian you don't look like an indian no no my mother told me i have high cheekbones oh that's why she was ending so what i named her pocahontas elizabeth warren and her goons and she's very nasty tier she hates year people share hate everything about you will keep their hands of bitcoin they're going to keep their hands of crypto they're going to let it grow with a letter grow on day one i will fire gary gensler and a point   i didn't know is that a popular  wow i didn't know use that unpopular let me say that get on day why i will fire gary gensler ha    i will appoint a new as you see chairman who believes that america should build the future not block the future which is what their and kamala harris wants to make him treasury secretary that's not good that's not good he was hillary clinton who's finance person did you know the crooked hillary remember correctly never you remember anybody remember he was the finance chairman of hillary clinton's campaign against the gentleman known as donald trump not a popular person within that actually she came to my wedding you know that to a great first lady baloney i came to a wedding and bill came to our wedding but it's amazing things when you run for office lotta things changing the life a lotta things change as president i will immediately shut down operation choke point to florida i want to show you they want to choke you out of business would not going to let that happen and no longer one year government sit by and watch as bitcoin jobs and businesses lead to other countries because america is laws are to unclear and too tough a to angry and to step we will keep each and every bitcoin job in the united states of america this will going to be doing upon take it off as i will immediately appoint a bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council would anybody like to be on that particular cash or high  their task will be to design transparent regulatory guidance for the benefit of the entire industry and they will get it done in one hundred days we will have regulations but from now on the rules will be written by people who love your industry not hate your industry people that one am make it clear and simple straightforward and fair people that want to see or industry thrives not dive next i will immediately ordered the treasury department and other federal agencies to cease and desist all steps necessary because you know there's a thing going on in your industry they want to move the creation of the central bank digital currency is over forget it c b d c there will never be a c b d c well i'm president of the and and i always defend their right to self custody so fast we're going to have a great and free you're going to have a great industry and we're going to be fuel for your industry that demolish your industry america were once again be a nation that protect property rights privacy freedom of transaction freedom of association and freedom of speech we're going to change their we're going to go back to the old days when we were a nation that was building that a nation this eating itself alive from within as part of our effort to provide regulatory clarity we will create a framework to enable the save responsible expansion of staple stable coins you know what to say about going is does anybody know please raise your hair allowing us to extend the dominance of the us dollar to new frontiers all around the world america will be rich year the world will be better and there will be billions and billions of people brought into crypto economy and storing their savings and bitcoin so that's the way it is that's pretty much the way it is those who say that bitcoin is a threat to the dollar have the story exactly backwards i believe it is exact lee back bitcoin is not threatening the dollar the behavior of the current us government is really threatening the dollar the danger to our financial future does that come from crypto it comes from washington dc it comes from trillions of dollars in waste rampant inflation and open borders while giving welfare and free health care to all of the illegal aliens that a pouring into our country by the millions and millions and millions it comes from printing hundreds of billions of dollars to fund endless wars oversee is well our cities are like combat zones here at home two weeks ago in chicago one hundred and seventeen people were shot and seventeen died afghanistan doesn't have anything like that in a you think about the place is look at what's happening with us cities what's happening in the last three years last three and a half years nobody's ever seen anything like a think of it a hundred seventeen over fourth of july weekend hundred seventeen people were shot and seventeen died this is the united states of america and i don't think so by the way when i was president we had no wars we had no new wars we didn't start and remember when hillary said he'll start wars look at his personality know i said my personality will keep us out of wars but we finish off some of the old ones like isis which they said would take five years to do maybe more we did it in four weeks he beat isis and for because we have a great military and it's not a woke military by the way maybe some of the people on top or work but this is not a work i get to see that first first one i looked at what they did and what they did for me they were unbelievable they did things that nobody thought were possible our our real generals and our soldiers as though they're trying to get him to be well but these people are not going to go woke i can guarantee that when your support this november we will restore confidence and we will restore common sense to our nation's capitol because ultimately it is about as that are you can show if you liberal are you progress as they like progress oh that sounds so nice it'll destroy our country actually become a terrible word and destroy our country but it's not about that it's about common sense we want to bring common sense back in this is all common sense that we're talking about today and bitcoin and crypto will skyrocket like never before even beyond your expectations and you are the pay people that are doing it as we stop the war on crypto well if we will immediately and will do this very quickly begin to build our economy because when america is prospering bitcoin restoring it it'll go up with a we had the greatest the economy ever and we will soon have it again under the trump administration a the typical middle class family income rose by six thousand dollars a year people don't like mentioning that america had more money to save than at any time in many decades as a result during my four years in office now you have to listen to these numbers these numbers and like beautiful and i don't want repeat myself listen to these numbers as a result during my for years and off his bitcoin surge by read thousand nine hundred percent from eight hundred and ninety eight dollars the day i took office to thirty five thousand nine hundred hundred dollars that day i love how is the biggest jump i guess in just about any and us to figure that now compare that to just after three and a half years of biden and harris adjusted for inflation bitcoin is up fifty percent now fifty percent sounds good but not when you're comparing it to almost four thousand percent by fifty percent normally a show that sounds pretty good listener put that into the speech fifty percent is that good when people can afford groceries or rent they have no savings to store and bitcoin this administration close the biggest inflation and the history of our country and that's what's happened or people have been wiped out from the very first day we take back the white hours we will replace the by the harris economic stack nation with a brand new trump economic boom you're going to have a tremendous bull you know you have a lot of great analysts out there scott talking about use got one of the greatest of all and others that say those stock market's going up because they think trump is going to be elected and it's trump isn't elected country's gonna go into a depression the likes of what you had and nineteen twenty nine and i hope that's not true but i can understand it and i can understand what they're saying stock market game they think is because looks like we're going to win the election and i don't know what's going to happen with the election you know they cheat like hell and i don't know what's gonna happen but if we win it this country's gonna be boomtown it's gonna be the booming like it never been before the current administration's economic plan includes trillions in new spending and five trillion dollar tax hikes in you want to increase taxes by five trillion dollars they want the exploration of the trump tax cuts to take place if they want a wealth confiscation tech so that when you make all of your money that you're going to make and all of the people you're going to employ they want to take away your money in the form of the first time ever attacks and a gigantic capital gains tax that will exceed substantially in many states over fifty percent my plan is the opposite way will live the workers and we will create shavers have so many people and we will reward success we will not punish success they want to punish success they want to punish genius not gonna let that happen i will make the trump tax cuts permanent and deliver a massive tax cuts for families and individuals and businesses that produce jobs that includes no tax on tips know that but you get rid of the tax on tips hi will cut unnecessary and burgers them regulations fight every everyday to make america the best place on earth to build a business including a crypto business going to be the best place you're not going to have to go to china you're not going to have gov g how do i learn chinese i want to learn it very quickly have a little granddaughter that speaks fluent chinese can you believe it and it's a wonderful think that it's that easy but you're not going to have to do it most importantly for our citizens we will end the inflation nightmare that this administration has created and we will ended quickly it's gotta and is destroying our country you know inflation is a country buster you can go back many many years to germinate you look at what happened to germany during their huge period of inflation destroyed the country it's a country buster the bitcoin years and i say to you that you recognize the dangers of inflation long before most others the you understood inflation frankly better than anybody else you know the a dodger if only they had listen they didn't listen to you they didn't listen you the trillions of dollars and ridiculous waste approved by our opponents resulted in the very inflation disaster that bitcoin years that always protected twenty thirty and even forty percent of the value of every down or was wiped out and wiped out quickly you understood that but a lot of other people didn't the life savings of millions of americans was rapidly destroyed and very simply uncontrolled inflation is a stealth taxation of the middle class it really is a stealth taxation i call it the by in tax now call it the harris tax or the harris by tax or whatever the hell we're going to call that but it's a it's a disaster to attacks and fifty percent it's a fifty percent tax inflation think of it it's a fifty percent tax on people five or this is a human tragedy and is destroyed people it's a nice show disgraced is destroyed everything in its way it must never be allowed to happen again and it won't when i'm president i guarantee you it won't happen because we're going to do things that make sure it doesn't happen they've allowed pricing to get totally out of control we're going to do energy gee bring it down to levels that people have not seen in many many years we had a that levels we were one dollar and eighty seven cents per gallon of gasoline you don't see that right now for four straight years under my leadership we had effectively know inflation know when i left office was one point four percent stay there for almost two years remember when biden said it was nine i inherited nine percent that was just like misinformation disinformation we gave them hot country we went through the covet we did an incredible job never get credit for that always get credit for the economy for the military we rebuilt the military we created space was we did so many different things never get credit for that you know what we gave them a great country with essentially no inflation and after two years they drove this country and they drove inflation through the roof who years cost of living one up in some cases by over fifty percent they say twenty two percent they're like to say twenty two but it could be much higher and it is my child depending on what they include they don't include things like interest rates that went from two point five percent to ten percent but vk get the money when i returned to the white house i was stopped the wild and wasteful spending this administration i will end the endless wars they never stop again we had no oil we're no new wars under your favorite president president trump we had no no we had no no wars they thought i was going to start a war let me tell you something up going to stop world war three because we're closer to world war three that we've ever been issues the end of world war two i will seal the boardroom stop the invasion of millions of people pouring into our country illegally we will totally to flee and we will do this quickly we will defeat inflation and together we will bring back the american dream for citizens of every race religion color and creed will bring it back the american dream you don't even hear the you don't even hear this statement american dream anymore you don't hear those words anymore we used to talk about the american dream a lot of you people are in the american dream but you're going to be crushed if you don't elect me i hate to tell you you don't know like we going to be crushed you're going to say alice water mistake it was we went for a person who has no talent he's been a failure it almost everything she's done instead of trump and look at us now we're going to move into an extremely small house from our beautiful house but we will end the war on american energy and we will very simply drill baby drill we're going to drill baby drill we after it's what we have we have more liquid gold under are free than any nation in the world more than saudi arabia more than russia we don't lose that we don't use if they lose that we don't use that we go on and bio oil from venezuela as amazing but we won't stop there we will harness american energy and all forms i have set the ambitious goal that by the end of my mitre the united states will be the number one lowest cost of energy and electricity of a nation or know we can make it so inexpensive because of what we have under our fate we can make it so inexpensively and with low energy costs america will become the world's undisputed bitcoin mining how are how she'll be of bitcoin mining power house you will not have to move your family to china we will not be moving to china as we implement reforms bitcoin and crypto will grow our economy segment american financial dominance and strengthen our entire country long into the future many americans do not realize that the united states government is among the largest holders of bitcoin does anyone know that how about that the federal government has almost two hundred and ten thousand bitcoins or one percent of the total
