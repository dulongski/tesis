you know these people really want to do a great think they wonder they really want it and they're putting up you know billions of dollars and they're going to do this plant and other plants and it's

nippon and day when everybody else we're all working together and i'm going to be in washington i'm going to be watching over it it's gotta be great but there is unbelievable spirit for what you're doing and i'm telling you you're going to find out that the great people of japan and we love them you know shinzo abby was my friend there was a great prime minister of japan and unfortunately no longer with us you know what happened russians so but he was a great friend of mine and a medal amazing man and it's an amazing country and you're going to have a tremendous relationship so thank you very much we were much of ratio very much appreciated for more than one hundred and twenty four years the men and women of us steel a poor the molten metal and forged the tempered beams that built is railroad bridge the mighty rivers and raised up towering skyscrapers like the ones we have in new york one hundred stories high and much higher than that the city of pittsburgh used to produce more sale the most entire countries could produce and it wasn't even close but are still work is no better than anyone decades of washington bridge trails and incompetence and stupid study and corruption cause this region over one hundred thousand steel jobs and they melted away just like butter about so way between the year two thousand and two thousand and sixteen more than half of all the job and pittsburgh iron and steel mills were obliterated there were just absolutely take it away like just take it away like you take away candy from a baby when i came into office eight years ago i proclaimed a simple but crucially important principle if you don't have steel you don't have a country you don't have a country you can't make a military what are we going to do so let's go to china to get our steel for the army tags and for the boat suggests a strong steel industry is not just a matter of dignity or prosperity and bri it's above all a matter of national security and it is you to see some amazing things year that's why i fought for the american she'll work or like no president has ever thought before that's why i one your votes like no president has ever won before and right from the beginning it didn't take long you've got it right from the beginning i think before i even open my mouth cause even as a private citizen i used to fight and say what are you letting all of the these countries come in and steal your jobs brigham to other countries why do you let that happen not only here but all over the country in twenty eighteen i impose historic tariffs on fire and steel and the results were amazing you wouldn't have this plant right now of i did put on twenty five and fifty percent tariffs they were dumping steelers you know from china and from all over the world they were dumping it all over our country dumping it and it was bad stuff was garbage but it was steel and it was cheap as hell and it was a terrible thing and you wouldn't have had any steel mills i don't think david have a steel mill open in the country and we didn't do the jars and it was just in time it was just in time they were closing up as fast as you can count in a few short years domestic steel production surged by more than ten million tons imports where we're foreign competitors dropped by twenty four percent almost immediately and more than fifteen billion dollars of investment poured into american steel throughout the united states all because you had a president who stood up for us steel workers and put america first a very proud of that were for everyone else but then came for kilometers years of a president who obviously wasn't doing the job i'm trying to be nice to have to be there or what he did to this country is a disgrace between the borders millions and millions of people pouring through our borders from all countries all over the world they came from the jails of the congo they came from all over south america prisons gangs drug dealers drug merchants they came from mental institutions the mentally insane that were pouring into our country by the millions they allowed this to happen to our country but we're moving amount of were moving amount faster we're bringing back to where they came from were having a lot of problems with the liberal judges and courts the radical left crazy judges that you know they come in without course they pour into our country totally on reddit and are jack nobody checked him nobody had any idea who they were eleven thousand eight hundred ninety eight of them were murderers fifty percent of those over eleven thousand people that were murderers fifty percent murdered more than one person and these people were allowed to come into our country by the democrats and you can never forget what they've done and a single we've beaten inflation look at what we've done look at the numbers it came out the prosperity that everything is good first time ever right track wrong track runner right track first time in twenty eight years but but they loud they allow that to happen i built almost seven hundred miles of wall and we didn't have the wall we could have never done what we did over seven hundred miles but still they came because they didn't want to finish it and want to close up any gap the gaps that we had to keep so that we could get our equipment out so we could get through that didn't want to put up the final stages it would have taken three weeks to put up the final stages they said no we don't want the wall built and i thought they were kidding but they weren't they wanted open borders and what they let into our country can never be forgotten the last administration granted tens of thousands of job killing tower of exemptions to year foreign competitors so they were afraid to take down the terror of said i impose because it was so good for our country so much money but what they did to think of those they gave exemption who's and there was so broad and so deep and i guess you saw that but the exemptions that they gave allowed foreign competitors come in and steal our industry steal our jobs and bring him back home and bring them home by the boat load crippling imports of foreign steel skyrocketed over the last four years like you have never seen before by over thirty percent as an incredible crazy number and imports of steel rebar from mexico exploded by more than thousand for said we were getting our steal from mexico we were getting our steal from canada we're getting i steal from every place but right here it was then that we announced the crown jewel of our steel industry us steel was being sold into foreign hands with no protections for our great steelworkers and i said there's no way we'll we're going to let that happen when i was watching over you you don't even know and i was watching over you our best people you the best people get built this country you know you people built this country you people and others like you built this country by the time i came into office many feared that the bar valley would lose up to three thousand steel jobs that us steel would close and there was a fixture of the pittsburgh skyline it may never live for another week we had times we thought we were going to live you aren't living for another week but i promise that people of western pennsylvania that i would never ever let that happen it as president i kept had promise boy did i get that wrong  so soon after additionally take it off as i impose powerful twenty five present arabs are all foreign steel and ended each and every one of the biden exceptions and exclusions and today i have a major announcement and are you ready to hear this this is on behalf of scott secretary of treasury our lutnick secretary of commerce and all of the great geniuses and people we have work and are they are smart but i don't think it be a good steelworkers got arms are going to put a little more muscle talented that guy but he's great is greater what he does we are going to be imposing a twenty five percent increase we're going to bring it from twenty five percent to fifty present the tariffs on steel into the united states of america which well further secure the steel industry in the united states nobody's going to get around the so we're bringing it up from twenty five percent with doubling up to fifty present and that's a little paul and by the way i have to tell you i believe that this group of people that just by this investments right now a very happy because that means that nobody's going to be able to steal your industry it's at twenty five present they can sort of get over that fence and fifty percent they can no longer get over the phone so congratulations to everybody and to prevent get a great deal you just made a better deal right i said to the group would you rather have a forty percent increase because hours they get about forty when i came as there would you rather have a forty present or a fifty present they said will take fifty i said i had i had a feeling you are going to say the so congratulations also congratulations the day because you got this whole thing started congratulations great job for a job the people here understand the word tower of and you understand it better than the people on wall street but now the people a wall street of finding out this a wow you know trump was right you so today they added announcer joker and cnbc maria bartiromo as who is so phantom as around fox business and they were saying you know trump was right look at these numbers the numbers got released today at eight o'clock in the morning and it showed no inflation and tremendous income jobs for workers and for the people of our country and they go while he was right new is right but you know that you know that before wall street this the workers do that we don't want to america's future to be built were shot a steal from shanghai we want it built with these strength and the bride of pittsburgh it's pittsburgh steelers us steel and it's gotta be something even more special when you get all that billions of dollars of new equipment that they're going to be investing right here billions and billions of the since i oppose are still tariffs and you know i said the tariff to me is the most beautiful word in the dictionary i love the word so much i've always loved it for forty years i've loved it for forty years i i didn't understand why people weren't in this country using care of the used tariffs to kill us they used arabs to take our business is not only steal other businesses do and we never knew how to use tariffs back because we had people in the white house that either didn't care or weren't very smart or both and it really starts with the white house is very simple as starts with a wide as but i said it's my favorite word in the dictionary the word tariff and i got slaughtered in a fake news i got kill they said what about love what about wife and family what about god they said so they made the word terror of be my fourth favorite word and now i have no complications it's my fourth favorite word god why family all of the different days but they they did it's not even believable as a terrorist is my favorite word and i get slaughtered by these people that we've had a lot of fun to jousted for a long time with fake news but companies all over the world of announced nearly ten billion dollars and new investments and steel just and steal alone but the nippon investment we're announcing today blows them all away with a record setting and this was just heard of we just came out little while ago forty teen billion dollar commitment to the future of this company that that is the single largest investment that's a single largest investment of any kind in any industries are not only steel go all the by back you go into fracking you're going to anything you want to go into because you're a good fracking state to we love fracking by the way but think it is they get is the largest investment don't have any kind in the history of the commonwealth of pennsylvania and we also will be the largest investment in the history of american steel industry there's never been a fourteen billion dollar investment in the history of the steel industry in the united states of america  and pittsburgh will very soon be respected around the world is this steel city again so i want to congratulate our as part of this monumental can been near pod will also invest two point two billion dollars to increase the production here in the mon valley works

million new jobs including ten thousand manufacturing jobs and those numbers are going through the roof were going to have close to eleven trillion dollars invested in new investments in the united states and you could look at other years is never been anything like that and by the way that's essentially in two months not four months because it took me a little time they get acclimated but over the last two two to have ones we have over eleven trillion dollars is going to becoming apple is spending five hundred billion dollars to invest in america not in china the video five hundred billion dollars t s m c if you look at this one t as m c he and this is a company the biggest in the world for chips two hundred billion dollars at least amazon four billion johnson and johnson fifty five billion dollars marks the alleges general motors are putting in billions and billions of dollars we have it all done it's gonna be all with very little inflation in fact it was two point one percent in april way down you went through inflation that was probably the greatest inflation and the history of our country over the last four years and now we have a down to around two percent grocery prices are down down mortgage rates are down energy prices are down and gasoline prices over memorial day weekend where the low as they have been since two thousand and three think that fact in a couple of states gasoline one dollar and ninety eight cents a gallon when of one of you heard that number lately income sword in april up point eight percent almost triple expectations and we achieve the largest drop in consumer prices are the largest increase in consumer confidence since the pandemic and actually probably about twenty years before the pandemic last but we also cut the trade deficit in half and that's the story of today they can't believe it the numbers just game which we cut before we even get started actually we cut it in half the trade death visit and very important lives stop the invasion of illegal aliens who are under cutting your wages and stealing your job you saw that last month ninety nine point nine nine nine percent can you imagine that was our cut it's been the border is close but it's open and it always be open to people that want to come into our country legally we want to have people come in legally but we don't want to have them come in the way they allowed to come in we've ended the flood of criminals gang members murderers drug dealers and human traffickers that were sending them back to the places for which they came and the future of american workers is only getting brighter i said before and i'll say it again we have the hottest country right now just for my words but actually you have to go back to november fifth since november fifth that was election day we had the greatest election victory they say it one hundred and twenty nine years the most consequential election and one hundred and twenty nine years i don't know what one hundred and twenty nine years was but we'll see i will check it out later on we'll find out was the been something pretty good but we have the most consequential we won every swing state we won the popular vote we won the district's two thousand seven hundred and fifty to five hundred and five were doing a job and you're doing a job and it's only because a you that we could add that success were right now the verge of passing the largest working class tax cuts in american history we gotta get that either of our big bill you hope your home as it is gotta get it passed the senate call your senators and outta you have you have great people representing you year senators or congressmen you have great people every single democrat house member voted to oppose the largest tax i can history the democrats are voting for the largest highest tax hike in history i've never heard of it before mean while our one big beautiful bill will keep income taxes at their current rates and deliver no tax on tips no tax or overtime and no tax on social security for our shoes  and we're going to make the interest payments as you know on cars were going to take the car payment said we're going to make them those address payments you buy a car you borrow money we're going to make address payments tax deductible but only of the car is made in america and that means made with american steel and she'll for the last year our permitted leave spanning the child tax credit and we're creating a special trump account for every newborn child starting them off with a one thousand dollar credit to be invested over the course of their life a little baby is born they're going to start off with a thousand dollars and then we do a good job of investing their money we're going to go with one of the one of the investing guidelines who the hell does if they're really good for they have a chance to be very rich it's going to be very cute to sue we're going to follow it very closely and critically the bill includes the largest reductions to wasteful spending at a generation or more slashing more than one point six trillion dollar as and waste fraud and abuse and one big beautiful bill and get out there and get your congressmen and senators and any other senator or congressman you know get him to vote for it because the democrats are willing to vote against the biggest tax deduction or tax a decrease in history this is the biggest tax cut think of it in the history of our country if it doesn't get approved you're going to have a sixty eight percent tax increase lots of luck and the democrats would rather have you have a tax increase think of the that of sixty eight percent they would rather have that happen then vote for a bill what you get the biggest tax cut so there's something wrong you know all my life i grow up i watch politics and i've always watched politicians say we will cut your taxes we will cut these democrats want to raise your taxes and in theory a sixty eight present increase one other thing i did and you probably saw it last week you know we pay the highest drug prices and pharmaceutical prices anywhere in the world by far other countries pay sometimes one tenth of what we pay a bill that cause twenty dollars we spend two hundred dollars two hundred and fifty dollars two hundred and seventy dollars in many cases is the most unfair thing i've ever seen and last week i did what had to be done and it was it easy gets the biggest lobby and they were probably in the world most powerful lobby the drug companies and i'm not even call it a bad but they were able to do things are going to be fine by the way they're going to just stabilize but we're going to now call a favorite day asians where we will pay the lowest price anywhere in the world and they have to match it we will be cutting your drug bill by eighty five it even ninety percent you know it is very proud and my first administration you may have remembered i called for a major press conference because we were the first i was the first one in twenty eight years to lower drug prices they were lowered one quarter of one percent over a period of year and i was so proud of that because nobody had ever had a british raise your prices of drugs went down one quarter of one percent not much now we're going to be lowering your drug caused by ninety percent by eighty five percent by seventy five present by numbers that nobody's ever heard of before we will be paying equal to the lowest price of drugs and pharmaceuticals anywhere in the world have fun because that's a lot of money that's going to break ground that's going to bring down medicare it's going to bring down the costs of think of the medicaid is going to have an effect on everything but it's going to have the biggest of effect in your wallet you're going to be saving a tremendous amount of money and nobody else would do that but be i have taken on some rather harsh critics over that because again that's the biggest lobby they spent billions and billions and billions of dollars a year not to have that done but i said it's really time to do it so you're going to have the lower as drug prices anywhere the world with one big beautiful bill we will project over seven million jobs raised take home pay for american families by up to thirteen thousand dollars per hour so and reduce taxes for working class americans by as much as thirteen present those a big numbers the bill will also remove one point for me in illegal aliens from medicaid and protect the programs for truly needy americans and it includes funny die or three thousand new border patrol agents and ten thousand new ice agents and these people like you these are heroes the jobs they have done they go into areas that are so dangerous it's unbelievable but a tough they're smart and they love our country so i want to just think ice and i want to thank the border patrol and i want to think law enforcement in general they've been incredible really and and i'll never forget our firemen i don't know if we have firemen that the but were going never going to forget our firemen they do a great job over the past four months we've accomplished more than most administration's achieve in four years or even eight years we've done this in four months we've done something or so period and optimism and bride which is sweeping across our land and with the announcement is surging like never before here in western pennsylvania remember the entire world is watching us today i make it a speech and i have millions and millions of at all the fake news back there look at that they are that's a lotta fake news come to think of now it's they've been pretty good do as year they've you know gave us a reasonably accurate display
